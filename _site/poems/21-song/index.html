   <h2>SONG</h2>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      Lovely, dark, and lonely one,<br/>
      Bare your bosom to the sun,<br/>
      Do not be afraid of light<br/>
      You who are a child of night.<br/>
      Open wide your arms to life,<br/>
      Whirl in the wind of pain and strife,<br/>
      Face the wall with the dark closed gate,<br/>
      Beat with bare, brown fists<br/>
      And wait.<br/>
      </p>
