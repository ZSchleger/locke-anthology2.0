   <h2>AN EARTH SONG</h2>
   
   
   <p class="stanza">
      It’s an earth song,<br/>
      And I’ve been waiting long for an earth song.<br/>
      It’s a spring song,—<br/>
      And I’ve been waiting long for a spring song.<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      Strong as the shoots of a new plant<br/>
      Strong as the bursting of new buds<br/>
      Strong as the coming of the first child from its mother’s<br/>
      womb.<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      It’s an earth song,<br/>
      A body-song,<br/>
      A spring song,—<br/>
      I have been waiting long for this spring song.<br/>
