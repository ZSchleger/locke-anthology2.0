   <h2>SONG OF THE SON</h2>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      Pour, O pour that parting soul in song,<br/>
      O pour it in the saw-dust glow of night,<br/>
      Into the velvet pine-smoke air to-night,<br/>
      And let the valley carry it along,<br/>
       And let the valley carry it along.<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      O land and soil, red soil and sweet-gum tree,<br/>
      So scant of grass, so profligate of pines,<br/>
      Now just before an epochâ€™s sun declines<br/>
      Thy son, in time, I have returned to thee,<br/>
      Thy son, I have in time returned to thee.<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      In time, although the sun is setting on<br/>
      A song-lit race of slaves, it has not set;<br/>
      Though late, O soil, it is not too late yet<br/>
      To catch thy plaintive soul, leaving, soon gone,<br/>
      Leaving, to catch thy plaintive soul soon gone.<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      O Negro slaves, dark purple ripened plums,<br/>
      Squeezed, and bursting in the pine-wood air,<br/>
      Passing, before they strip the old tree bare<br/>
      One plum was saved for me, one seed becomes<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      An everlasting song, a singing tree,<br/>
      Caroling softly souls of slavery,<br/>
      What they were, and what they are to me,<br/>
      Carolling softly souls of slavery.<br/>
      </p>
   Profound.<br/>
