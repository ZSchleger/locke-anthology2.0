   <h2>HARLEM WINE</h2>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      This is not water running here,<br/>
      These thick rebellious streams<br/>
      That hurtle flesh and bone past fear<br/>
      Down alleyways of dreams.<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      This is a wine that must flow on<br/>
      Not caring how or where,<br/>
      So it has ways to flow upon<br/>
      Where song is in the air.<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      So it can woo an artful flute<br/>
      With loose, elastic lips,<br/>
      Its measurement of joy compute<br/>
      With blithe, ecstatic hips.<br/>
      </p>
