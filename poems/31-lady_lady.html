   <h2>LADY LADY</h2>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      Lady, Lady, I saw your face,<br/>
      Dark as night withholding a star.<br/>
      The chisel fell, or it might have been<br/>
      You had borne so long the yoke of men.<br/>
      </p>
   
   
   <p class="stanza">
      Lady, Lady, I saw your hands,<br/>
      Twisted, awry- like crumpled roots,<br/>
      Bleached poor white in a sudsy tub,<br/>
      Wrinkled and drawn from your rub-a-dub.<br/>
      </p>
   
   
   <p class="stanza">
      Lady, Lady, I saw your heart,<br/>
      And altared there in its darksome place<br/>
      Were the tongues of flame the ancients knew,<br/>
      Where the good God sits to spangle through.<br/>
      </p>
