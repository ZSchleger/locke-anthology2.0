   <h2>RUSSIAN CATHEDRAL</h2>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      Bow down my soul in worship very low<br/>
      And in the holy silences be lost.<br/>
      Bow down before the marble man of woe,<br/>
      Bow down before the singing angel host.<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      What jewelled glory fills my spirit's eye!<br/>
      What golden grandeur moves the depths of me!<br/>
      The soaring arches lift me up on high<br/>
      Taking my breath with their rare symmetry.<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      Bow down my soul and let the wondrous light<br/>
      Of Beauty bathe thee from her lofty throne<br/>
      Bow down before the wonder of man's might.<br/>
      Bow down in worship, humble and alone;<br/>
      Bow lowly down before the sacred sight<br/>
      Of man's divinity alive in stone.<br/> 
      </p>
