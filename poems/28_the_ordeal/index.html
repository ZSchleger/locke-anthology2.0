   <h2>THE ORDEAL</h2>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      Ho! my brother,<br/>
      Pass me not by so scornfully<br/>
      I’m doing this living of being black,<br/>
      Perhaps I bear your own life-pack,<br/>
      And heavy, heavy is the load<br/>
      That bends my body to the road.<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      But I have kept a smile for fate,<br/>
      I neither cry, nor cringe, nor hate,<br/>
      Intrepidly, I strive to bear<br/>
      This handicap. The planets wear<br/>
      The Maker’s imprint, and with mine<br/>
      I swing into their rhythmic line;<br/>
      I ask—only for destiny,<br/>
      Mine, not thine.<br/>
      </p>
