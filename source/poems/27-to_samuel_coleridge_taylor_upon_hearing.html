   <h2>“TO SAMUEL COLERIDGE TAYLOR, UPON HEARING HIS 'SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE A MOTHERLESS
      CHILD'”</h2>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      Strange to a sensing motherhood,<br/>
      Loved as a toy—not understood,<br/>
      Child of a dusky father, bold;<br/>
      Frail little captive, exiled, cold.<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      Oft when the brooding planets sleep,<br/>
      You through their drowsy empires creep,<br/>
      Flinging your arms through their empty space,<br/>
      Seeking the breast of an unknown face.<br/>
      </p>
