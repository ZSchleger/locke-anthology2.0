   <p class="stanza">
      My father is a quiet man<br/>
      With sober, steady ways;<br/>
      For simile, a folded fan;<br/>
      His nights are like his days.<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      My mother’s life is puritan,<br/>
      No hint of cavalier,<br/>
      A pool so calm you’re sure it can<br/>
      Have little depth to fear.<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      And yet my father’s eyes can boast<br/>
      How full his life has been;<br/>
      There haunts them yet the languid ghost<br/>
      Of some still sacred sin.<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      And though my mother chants of God,<br/>
      And of the mystic river,<br/>
      I’ve seen a bit of checkered sod<br/>
      Set all her flesh aquiver.<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      Why should he deem it pure mischance<br/>
      A son of his is fain<br/>
      To do a naked tribal dance<br/>
      Each time he hears the rain?<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      Why should she think it devil’s art<br/>
      That all my songs should be<br/>
      Of love and lovers, broken heart,<br/>
      And wild sweet agony?<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      Who plants a seed begets a bud,<br/>
      Extract of that same root;<br/>
      Why marvel at the hectic blood<br/>
      That flushes this wild fruit?<br/>
      </p>
