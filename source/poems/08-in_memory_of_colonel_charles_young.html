   <h2>IN MEMORY OF COLONEL CHARLES YOUNG</h2>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      Along the shore the tall, thin grass<br/>
      That fringes that dark river,<br/>
      While sinuously soft feet pass,<br/>
      Begins to bleed and quiver.<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      The great dark voice breaks with a sob<br/>
      Across the womb of night;<br/>
      Above your grave the tom-toms throb,<br/>
      And the hills are weird with light.<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      The great dark heart is like a well<br/>
      Drained bitter by the sky,<br/>
      And all the honeyed lies they tell<br/>
      Come there to thirst and die.<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      No lie is strong enough to kill<br/>
      The roots that work below;<br/>
      From your rich dust and slaughtered will<br/>
      A tree with tongues will grow.<br/>
      </p>
