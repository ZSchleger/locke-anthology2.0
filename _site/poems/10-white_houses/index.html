   <h2>WHITE HOUSES</h2>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      Your door is shut against my tightened face,<br/>
      And I am sharp as steel with discontent;<br/>
      But I possess the courage and the grace<br/>
      To bear my anger proudly and unbent.<br/>
      The pavement slabs burn loose beneath my feet,<br/>
      A chafing savage, down the decent street,<br/>
      And passion rends my vitals as I pass,<br/>
      Where boldly shines your shuttered door of glass.<br/>
      Oh I must search for wisdom every hour,<br/>
      Deep in my wrathful bosom sore and raw,<br/>
      And find in it the superhuman power<br/>
      To hold me to the letter of your law!<br/>
      Oh I must keep my heart inviolate<br/>
      Against the potent poison of your hate.<br/>
      </p>
