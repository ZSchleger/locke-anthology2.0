   <h2>LIKE A STRONG TREE</h2>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      Like a strong tree that in the virgin earth<br/>
      Sends far its roots through rock and loam and clay,<br/>
      And proudly thrives in rain or time of dearth,<br/>
      When the dry waves scare rainy sprites away;<br/>
      Like a strong tree that reaches down, deep, deep,<br/>
      For sunken water, fluid underground,<br/>
      Where the great-ringed unsightly blind worms creep,<br/>
      And queer things of the nether world abound:<br/>
      So would I live in rich imperial growth,<br/>
      Touching the surface and the depth of things,<br/>
      Instinctively responsive unto both,<br/>
      Tasting the sweets of being and the stings,<br/>
      Sensing the subtle spell of changing forms,<br/>
      Like a strong tree against a thousand storms.<br/>
