   <h2>THE DAY-BREAKERS</h2>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      We are not come to wage a strife<br/>
      With swords upon this hill,<br/>
      It is not wise to waste the life<br/>
      Against a stubborn will.<br/>
      Yet would we die as some have done.<br/>
      Beating a way for the rising sun.<br/>
