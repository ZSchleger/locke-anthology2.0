   <h2>THE NEGRO SPEAKS OF RIVERS</h2>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      I’ve known rivers . . .<br/>
      I’ve known rivers ancient as the world and older than the flow<br/>
      of human blood in human veins.<br/>
      My soul has grown deep like the rivers.<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      I bathed in the Euphrates when dawns were young,<br/>
      I built my hut near the Congo and it lulled me to sleep,<br/>
      I looked upon the Nile and raised the pyramids above it.<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      I heard the singing of the Mississippi when<br/>
      
      Abe Lincoln went down to New Orleans,<br/>
      And I’ve seen its muddy bosom turn all golden in the sunset.<br/>
      </p>
   
   <p class="stanza">
      I’ve known rivers:<br/>
      Ancient, dusky rivers,<br/>
      My soul has grown deep like the rivers.<br/>
      </p>
